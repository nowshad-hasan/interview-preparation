 ### OOP

 > OOP concepts for Java language

 * Explain OOP Concepts.

   > Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology of designing a program using classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism,  abstraction, and encapsulation.

   - Inheritance [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-java/)
   - Polymorphism [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/polymorphism-in-java/)
   - Encapsulation [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encapsulation-in-java/)
   - Abstraction [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstraction-in-java-2/)<br/>
    <br/>
 * Differences between abstract classes and interfaces? [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-abstract-class-and-interface-in-java/)

   - An abstract class, is a class that contains both concrete and abstract methods
   (methods without implementations). An abstract method must be implemented by the abstract class
    sub-classes. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and need to be extended to be used.
   - Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables. Interface has only static and final variables.<br/>

  * What is the difference between iterator and enumeration in java? [Javaconceptoftheday](https://javaconceptoftheday.com/differences-between-enumeration-vs-iterator-in-java/), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/948194/difference-between-java-enumeration-and-iterator)
    - **Fail-Fast Vs Fail-Safe** - Iterator is a fail-fast in nature. i.e it throws ConcurrentModificationException if a collection is modified while iterating other than it’s own remove() method. Where as Enumeration is fail-safe in nature. It doesn’t throw any exceptions if a collection is modified while iterating. [See more](https://javaconceptoftheday.com/fail-fast-and-fail-safe-iterators-in-java-with-examples/)

    - **Safe And Secure** - As Iterator is fail-fast in nature and doesn’t allow modification of a collection by other threads while iterating, it is considered as safe and secure than Enumeration.

    - **Which One To Use** - According to Java API Docs, Iterator is always preferred over the Enumeration. Here is the note from the Enumeration Docs.

      NOTE: *The functionality of this interface is duplicated by the Iterator interface. In addition, Iterator adds an optional remove operation, and has shorter method names. New implementations should consider using Iterator in preference to Enumeration.*

  * Do you agree we use composition over inheritance?  

    The `java.util.Properties` class is a good example of a bad use of inheritance. Rather than using a Hashtable to store its properties, it extends Hashtable, in order to reuse its methods and to avoid reimplementing some of them using delegation. </br>

 * **Difference between method overloading and overriding.**
          <p align="center">
          <img alt="Overloading and Overriding" src="https://github.com/codeshef/android-interview-questions/blob/master/assets/overloading-vs-overriding.png">
          </p>
      - Overloading happens at compile-time while Overriding happens at runtime: The binding of overloaded method call to its definition happens at compile-time however binding of overridden method call to its definition happens at runtime.
      More info on static vs. dynamic binding: [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19017258/static-vs-dynamic-binding-in-java).
      - Static methods can be overloaded which means a class can have more than one static method of same name. Static methods cannot be overridden, even if you declare a same static method in child class it has nothing to do with the same method of parent class as overridden static methods are chosen by the reference class and not by the class of the object.

          So, for example:
          ```java
          public class Animal {
              public static void testClassMethod() {
                  System.out.println("The static method in Animal");
              }

              public void testInstanceMethod() {
                  System.out.println("The instance method in Animal");
              }
          }

          public class Cat extends Animal {
              public static void testClassMethod() {
                  System.out.println("The static method in Cat");
              }

              public void testInstanceMethod() {
                  System.out.println("The instance method in Cat");
              }

              public static void main(String[] args) {
                  Cat myCat = new Cat();
                  myCat.testClassMethod();
                  Animal myAnimal = myCat;
                  myAnimal.testClassMethod();
                  myAnimal.testInstanceMethod();
              }
          }
          ```
          Will output:
          ```java
          The static method in Cat    // testClassMethod() is called from "Cat" reference

          The static method in Animal // testClassMethod() is called from "Animal" reference,
                                      // ignoring actual object inside it (Cat)

          The instance method in Cat  // testInstanceMethod() is called from "Animal" reference,
                                      // but from "Cat" object underneath
          ```

          The most basic difference is that overloading is being done in the same class while for overriding base and child classes are required. Overriding is all about giving a specific implementation to the inherited method of parent class.

          Static binding is being used for overloaded methods and dynamic binding is being used for overridden/overriding methods.
          Performance: Overloading gives better performance compared to overriding. The reason is that the binding of overridden methods is being done at runtime.

          Private and final methods can be overloaded but they cannot be overridden. It means a class can have more than one private/final methods of same name but a child class cannot override the private/final methods of their base class.

          Return type of method does not matter in case of method overloading, it can be same or different. However in case of method overriding the overriding method can have more specific return type (meaning if, for example, base method returns an instance of Number class, all overriding methods can return any class that is extended from Number, but not a class that is higher in the hierarchy, like, for example, Object is in this particular case).

          Argument list should be different while doing method overloading. Argument list should be same in method Overriding.
  It is also a good practice to annotate overridden methods with `@Override` to make the compiler be able to notify you if child is, indeed, overriding parent's class method during compile-time.

  * **What is Polymorphism? What about Inheritance?**
   - Polymorphism in Java has two types: Compile time polymorphism (static binding) and Runtime polymorphism (dynamic binding). Method overloading is an example of static polymorphism, while method overriding is an example of dynamic polymorphism.

	 An important example of polymorphism is how a parent class refers to a child class object.  In fact, any object that satisfies more than one IS-A relationship is polymorphic in nature.

	 For instance, let’s consider a class `Animal` and let `Cat` be a subclass of `Animal`. So, any cat IS animal. Here, Cat satisfies the IS-A relationship for its own type as well as its super class Animal.
   - Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.

	 The class which inherits the properties of other is known as subclass (derived class, child class) and the class whose properties are inherited is known as superclass (base class, parent class).

	 Inheritance uses the keyword `extends` to inherit the properties of a class. Following is the syntax of extends keyword.
	 ```java
	 class Super {
	   .....
	   .....
  	}
	 class Sub extends Super {
	   .....
	   .....
	 }
	 ```

        - Singleton [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)
          A singleton is a class that can only be instantiated once. This singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The concept is sometimes generalized to systems that operate more efficiently when only one object exists, or that restrict the instantiation to a certain number of objects.

    * **Explain Generics in Java?**
       - Generics were included in Java language to provide stronger type checks, by allowing the programmer to define, which classes can be used with other classes
           > In a nutshell, generics enable types (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces and methods. Much like the more familiar formal parameters used in method declarations, type parameters provide a way for you to re-use the same code with different inputs. The difference is that the inputs to formal parameters are values, while the inputs to type parameters are types. ([Official Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/why.html))

       - This means that, for example, you can define:
           ```java
           List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
           ```
           And let the compiler take care of noticing, if you put some object, of type other than `Integer` into this list and warn you.
       - It should be noted that standard class hierarchy *does not* apply to generic types. It means that `Integer` in `List<Integer>` is not inherited from `<Number>` - it is actually inherited directly from `<Object>`. You can still put some constraints on what classes can be passed as a parameter into a generic by using [wildcards](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/generics/wildcards.html) like `<?>`, `<? extends MyCustomClass>` or `<? super Number>`.
       - While generics are very useful, late inclusion into Java language has put some restraints on their implementation - backward compatibility required them to remain just "syntactic sugar" - they are erased ([type erasure](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/erasure.html)) during compile-time and replaced with `object` class.

  ### Objects and Primitives

 > String related interview questions

 * String vs StringBuffer vs StringBuilder - [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-vs-stringbuilder-vs-stringbuffer-in-java/)
 * StringJoiner -  [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/use-stringjoiner-stringbuilder/), [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/java-string-joiner)
 * String concatenation techniques- [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/java-strings-concatenation)
 * **How is `String` class implemented? Why was it made immutable?**
  - There is no primitive variant of `String` class in Java language - all strings are just wrappers around underlying array of characters, which is declared `final`. This means that, once a `String` object is instantiated, it cannot be changed through normal tools of the language (Reflection still can mess things up horribly, because in Java no object is truly immutable). This is why `String` variables in classes are the first candidates to be used, when you want to override `hashCode()` and `equals()` of your class - you can be sure, that all their required contracts will be satisfied.
    > Note: The String class is immutable, so that once it is created a String object cannot be changed. The String class  has a number of methods, some of which will be discussed below, that appear to modify strings. Since strings are  immutable, what these methods really do is create and return a new string that contains the result of the operation. ([Official Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/strings.html))

    This class is also unique in a sense, that, when you create an instance like this:
    ```java
    String helloWorld = "Hello, World!";
    ```
    `"Hello, World!"` is called a *literal* and compiler creates a `String` object with its' value. So
    ```java
    String capital = "Hello, World!".toUpperCase();
    ```
    is a valid statement, that, firstly, will create an object with literal value "Hello, World!" and then will create and return another object with value "HELLO, WORLD!"
  - `String` was made immutable to prevent malicious manipulation of data, when, for example, user login or other sensitive data is being send to a server.

* **What does it means to say that a `String` is immutable?**
    - It means that once created, `String` object's `char[]` (its' containing value) is declared `final` and, therefore, it can not be changed during runtime.


* **What is `String.intern()`? When and why should it be used?** [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10578984/what-is-java-string-interning), [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interning-of-string/)

* **Can you list 8 primitive types in java?** [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-types-in-java/), [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/java-primitives), [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)

* **What is the difference between an Integer and int?**
  - `int` is a primitive data type (with `boolean`, `byte`, `char`, `short`, `long`, `float` and `double`), while `Integer` (with `Boolean`, `Byte`, `Character`, `Short`,`Long`, `Float` and `Double`) is a [wrapper](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/numberclasses.html) class that encapsulates primitive data type, while providing useful methods to perform different tasks with it. Read more from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-an-integer-and-int-in-java/). </br></br>

* **What is Autoboxing and Unboxing?**
  - Autoboxing and Unboxing is the process of automatic wrapping (putting in a box) and unwrapping (getting the value out) of primitive data types, that have "wrapper" classes. So `int` and `Integer` can (almost always) be used interchangeably in Java language, meaning a method `void giveMeInt(int i) { ... }` can take `int` as well as `Integer` as a parameter. </br>

  Read more: [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/autoboxing.html), [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/autoboxing-unboxing-java/)

* Typecast in Java.
    - In Java, you can use casts to polymorph one class into another, compatible one. For example:
        ```java
            long i = 10l;
            int j = (int) i;
            long k = j;
        ```
        Here we see, that, while narrowing (`long i` -> `int j`) requires an explicit cast to make sure the programmer realizes, that there may be some data or precision loss, widening (`int j` -> `long k`) does not require an explicit cast, because there can be no data loss (`long` can take larger numbers than `int` allows).


* **Do objects get passed by reference or value in Java? Elaborate on that.**
    - In Java all primitives and objects are passed by value, meaning that their copy will be manipulated in the receiving method. But there is a caveat - when you pass an object reference into a method, a *copy of this reference* is made, so it still points to the same object. This means, that any changes that you make to the insides of this object are retained, when the method exits.
        ```java
        public class Pointer {

            int innerField;

            public Pointer(int a) {
                this.innerField = a;
            }
        }
        ```
        ```java
            public class ValueAndReference {

            public static void main(String[] args) {

                Pointer a = new Pointer(0);
                int b = 1;

                print("Before:");
                print("b = " + b);
                print("a.innerField = " + a.innerField);
                exampleMethod(a, b);
                print("After:");
                print("b = " + b);
                print("a.innerField = " + a.innerField);
            }

            static void exampleMethod(Pointer a, int b) {
                a.innerField = 2;
                b = 10;
            }

            static void print(String text) {
                System.out.println(text);
            }
        }
        ```
        Will output:
        ```java
            Before:

            b = 1

            a.innerField = 0

            After:

            b = 1        // a new local int variable was created and operated on, so "b" didn't change

            a.innerField = 2 // Pointer a got its' innerField variable changed
                             //  from 0 to 2, because method was operating on
                             //  the same reference to an instance
        ```

* **What is the difference between instantiation and initialization of an object?**
    - Initialization is the process of the memory allocation, when a new variable is created. Variables should be explicitly given a value, otherwise they may contain a random value that remained from the previous variable that was using the same memory space. To avoid this problem, Java language assigns default (right after initialization) values to some data types:
        * `boolean` defaults to `false`;
        * `byte` defaults to `0`;
        * `short` defaults to `0`;
        * `int` defaults to `0`;
        * `long` defaults to `0L`;
        * `char` defaults to `\u0000`;
        * `float` defaults to `0.0f`;
        * `double` defaults to `0.0d`;
        * `object` defaults to `null`.
    - Instantiation is the process of explicitly assigning definitive value to a declared variable:
        ```java
            int j;  // Initialized variable (int defaults to 0 right after)
            j = 10; // Instantiated variable
        ```

* **What the difference between local, instance and class variables?**
  - Local variables exist only in methods that created them, they are stored separately in their respected Thread Stack (for more information, see question about Java Memory Model) and cannot have their reference passed outside of the method scope. That also means that they cannot be assigned any access modifier or made `static` - because they only exist during enclosing method's execution and those modifiers just do not make sense, since no other outside method can get them anyway.
  - Instance variables are the ones, that are declared in classes and their value can be different from one instance of the class to another, but they always require that class' instance to exist.
  - Class variables are those, that are marked with `static` keyword in their class' body. They can only have one value across all instances of that class (changing it in one place will change it in their class and, therefore, in all instances) and can even be retrieved without that class' instance (if their access modifier allows it).</br></br>

### Java Memory Model and Garbage Collector

* **What is garbage collector? How does it work?**
  - All objects are allocated on the heap area managed by the JVM.
  As long as an object is being referenced, the JVM considers it alive.
  Once an object is no longer referenced and therefore is not reachable by the application code,
  the garbage collector removes it and reclaims the unused memory. </br>

### Others

* **What is serialization? How do you implement it?**
    - Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes in order to store
    an object into memory, so that it can be recreated at a later time, while still keeping the
    object's original state and data. In Android you may use either the Serializable, Externalizable (implements Serializable) or Parcelable interfaces.
    - While Serializable is the easiest to implement, Externalizable may be used if you need to insert custom logic into the process of serialization (although it is almost never used nowadays as it is considered a relic from early versions of Java). But it is highly recommended to use Parcelable in Android instead, as Parcelable was created exclusively for Android and it performs about 10x faster than Serializable, because Serializable uses reflection, which is a slow process and tends to create a lot of temporary objects and it may cause garbage collection to occur more often.
    - To use Serializable all you have to do is implement the interface:

        ```java
        /**
        *  Implementing the Serializeable interface is all that is required
        */
        public class User implements Serializable {

            private String name;
            private String email;

                public User() {
                }

                public String getName() {
                    return name;
                }

                public void setName(final String name) {
                    this.name = name;
                }

                public String getEmail() {
                    return email;
                }

                public void setEmail(final String email) {
                    this.email = email;
                }
            }
        ```

                    /**

                     * the constructor that takes a Parcel is needed.
                     */
                    @Override
                    public User createFromParcel(Parcel in) {
                        return new User(in);

                /**

* **What are these `final`, `finally` and `finalize` keywords?**
  - `final` is a keyword in the java language. It is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable. Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed.
	```java
	class FinalExample {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			final int x=100;
			x=200;//Compile Time Error because x is final
		}
	}
	```
  - `finally` is a code block and is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not.
	```java
	class FinallyExample {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			try {
				int x=300;
			}catch(Exception e) {
				System.out.println(e);
			}
			finally {
				System.out.println("finally block is executed");
			}
		}
	}
	```
  - `Finalize` is a method used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.
	```java
	class FinalizeExample {
		public void finalize() {
			System.out.println("finalize called");
		}

		public static void main(String[] args) {
			FinalizeExample f1=new FinalizeExample();
			FinalizeExample f2=new FinalizeExample();
			f1=null;
			f2=null;
			System.gc();
		}
	}
	```

* **What does the `static` word mean in Java?**
    - In case of `static` variable it means that this variable (its' value or the object it references) spans across all instances of enclosing class (changing it in one instance affects all others), while in case of `static` methods it means that these methods can be invoked without an instance of their enclosing class. It is useful, for example, when you create util classes that need not be instantiated every time you want to use them. </br>

* **Can a `static` method be overridden in Java?** [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/can-we-overload-or-override-static-methods-in-java/)
  - While child class can override a static method with another static method with the same signature (return type can be downcasted), it is not truly overridden - it becomes "hidden", but both methods can still be accessed under right circumstances (see question about overloading/overriding above).

* **When is a `static` block run?**
    - Code inside static block is executed only once: the first time you make an object of that class or the first time you access a static member of that class (even if you never make an object of that class).</br>

* **What is Dependency Injection?  Can you name few libraries? Have you used any?**
  - Dependency injection is a very powerful technique, where you relay the task of providing object with its' dependencies on instances of other objects (OOP Composition, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition?oldformat=true)) to a separate class. This allows for fewer constructors, setters, factories and builders as all those functions are taken care of by the DI framework that you use. Also, and it may seem as a minor advantage, but if you use DI framework you need not worry about going through the project and changing all of (example names) `YourCustomInterface customInterfaceObject = new YourCustomClass();` to a new implementaion, as long as your new class (in place of `YourCustomClass`) still implements `CustomInterface` - you can just tweak the DI factory class to produce new class and voila - this new class will be automatically instantiated throughout your code. This allows for better maintenence and control over the program. Another example of DI usage is unit-testing - it allows to conveniently inject all needed dependencies and keep the amount of written code at a lower level.
   - One of the most popular libraries for DI for Android is Dagger 2. [MindOrks](https://blog.mindorks.com/a-complete-guide-to-learn-dagger-2-b4c7a570d99c), [Medium](https://medium.com/@harivigneshjayapalan/dagger-2-for-android-beginners-introduction-be6580cb3edb)
